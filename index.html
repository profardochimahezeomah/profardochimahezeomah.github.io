<h2><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Biography</h2>
<p><strong>Prof. Ardo Chimah Ezeomah</strong></p>
<p>Professor (Ardo) Chimah Ezeomah, 93, passed away in Akure, Ondo State
on September 14, 2025. He had an incredibly great sense of humor. He
loved laughing, spending time with friends and family, good music,
helping others and working with nomadic and migrant populations to
provide equitable educational opportunities. He took great pleasure in
teaching, mentoring and collaborating with colleagues in Nigeria and
internationally to advance the cause of marginalized populations
educationally.</p>
<p>Born on 10 May 1932, Prof. Ardo Chimah Ezeomah was a distinguished
Nigerian scholar, administrator, nation-builder, humanitarian,
colleague, mentor, and loving son, husband, father, grandfather,
brother, uncle and friend. His life’s work built bridges of
opportunities for the nomadic child, widening access to quality
education without uprooting their culture or livelihood. After early
teaching appointments that honed his gift for mentorship, he earned a
B.A. Ed. (History/English) from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka
(1964–1967), an M.Ed. in Administration &amp; Planning from Ahmadu Bello
University, Zaria (1973–1975), and a Ph.D. in Educational Planning from
the University of Jos (1976–1980). He rose from classroom teacher and
principal to Lecturer I, Associate Professor, and ultimately Professor
of Educational Administration &amp; Planning at the University of
Jos.</p>
<p>From his humble beginnings as a classroom teacher at ECWA Teachers’
College, Kaltungo; Enuda College, Abiriba; and S.I.M. Girls’ Secondary
School, Kwoi, to his tenure as Principal of Community Secondary School,
Nassarawa, he inspired future generations of leaders. He later joined
the Institute of Education at ABU as Lecturer I, and most enduringly,
the University of Jos, where he shaped countless students and scholars.
A true trailblazer, his scholarship broke new ground in the education of
nomadic peoples, particularly the Fulani, producing influential books,
monographs, and policy papers that combined rigorous research with
profound human empathy. This not only earned him the title of Ardo,
meaning leader, conferred by the pastorialist Fulani, but also the
esteemed title of founding father of nomadic education in Nigeria. In
1982, UNESCO/UNDP honoured him with the Paul G. Hoffman International
Award for his “outstandingly significant” contribution to designing
learning for nomadic families, a global recognition for a life devoted
to access and equity.</p>
<p>His interest in nomadic education took root in the early 1970s while
teaching in Northern Nigeria, where he often enjoyed his conversations
with pastoral Fulanis while purchasing fura da nono, listening, and
learning more about them. He recognised a brilliant, resilient people
and envisioned educational platforms integrated with their daily
movements and social structures. He theorized, and later demonstrated,
that aligning schooling with pastoral life would enable equitable access
without disrupting socio-economic realities, leading to higher success
rates. After his master’s programme at ABU Zaria, he committed his
career to developing effective methods and policies for nomadic
education. His Ph.D. investigated strategies for educating nomadic
pastoral Fulɓe (Fulani), and his sustained research through the late
1970s and early 1980s attracted UNDP/UNESCO support (1984–1989) to the
University of Jos, culminating in a suite of technical reports,
implementation guides, and policy frameworks that informed practice
nationwide. Notable collaborators on this UNDP/UNESCO project included:
Adepotu A.A., Ukachi L.A., Onwuzuruike; Sikoki B.S., Lar M., Alaezi O.,
Dalli A.L., Joof A.F., Diallo A., Amali E., Egbe E.N., Ihemegbulam V.C.
He then served as the inaugural director and head of research at the
Center for Nomadic Education, University of Jos.</p>
<p>These pioneering efforts helped spur the establishment of the
National Commission for Nomadic Education (NCNE) in Kaduna, where he
answered the call to national service as the inaugural Executive
Secretary (1990–1994). He later served as Dean, Faculty of Education,
University of Jos (1995–1997), and sat on the University’s governing
council, leading with integrity and vision. A member of numerous
national and international scholarly bodies, he carried Nigeria’s
scholarship onto the world stage while remaining rooted in community
service at home. Beyond his intellectual accomplishments lay an uncommon
grace: the ability to connect with anyone, to build and sustain
relationships, and to touch many through devotion and kindness.</p>
<p>Ardo was a humanitarian at heart. Beyond scholarship, he was a man of
uncommon generosity. Newspaper accounts recalled how Fulani students
lived under his roof in Jos, fed, mentored, and sponsored through school
without discrimination. His home became a haven for those in need, and
his ability to connect across ethnicity, class, or religion was
legendary.</p>
<p>A devoted husband and father of eight children and one stepson, he
lived the values he taught: discipline, compassion, and steadfast faith.
He was also the father to over 12 adopted children including more than 3
Fulani sons. He was an umbrella that gave many shelter from the rains of
life. His legacy endures in the NCNE he helped to establish, the nomadic
schools he nurtured, the policies he shaped, the books that still guide
practitioners, and the many lives he lifted. Prof. Ezeomah walked softly
but left deep footprints in moving sands: footprints of justice, equity,
access, knowledge, and love of neighbour.</p>
