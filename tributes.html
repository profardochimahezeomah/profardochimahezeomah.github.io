<strong>Tribute to Late Professor Chimah Ezeomah</strong>
</div>
<p>The passing of Professor Chimah Ezeomah has stirred deep emotions and
rekindled cherished memories of a man whose life was marked by grace,
intellect, and uncommon humility. He was a rare breed, gentle yet firm,
scholarly yet humane, humble yet full of quiet strength. His simplicity
and sense of purpose reflected a man who lived not for himself but for
others.</p>
<p>Professor Ezeomah was a source of pride, encouragement, and
inspiration to me. He took a genuine interest in my career from the
moment I enlisted in the Nigerian Defence Academy and followed my
progress with fatherly affection and admiration. His presence at my
convocation, commissioning, and passing-out parade was a testament to
his deep belief in discipline, excellence, and the power of
encouragement. I vividly recall his warm embrace and his prayerful
words, which left an enduring imprint on my heart. His death is a great
personal loss and a profound reminder of the transient nature of life.
Yet, I find comfort in knowing that he lived meaningfully — imparting
knowledge, nurturing relationships, and leaving behind a legacy that
will stand the test of time. He exemplified the quiet dignity of a
teacher whose lessons extended far beyond the classroom, touching hearts
and shaping destinies. I pray that the Almighty God grants his noble
soul eternal rest and comforts the entire family. May the virtues he
embodied — humility, wisdom, and love — continue to guide and unite all
who were privileged to know him.</p>
<p>Adieu to a great mentor, scholar, and father figure.</p>

<strong>Tribute to Professor Chimah Ezeomah (1932–2025):</strong><br> A
Visionary of Nomadic Education and a True Nigerian

</div>
<p>Prof. Chimah Ezeomah was more than a scholar; he was a pioneer whose
intellectual passion and humanity shaped one of the most remarkable
educational innovations in Nigeria: the Nomadic Education Programme. As
a Professor of Educational Administration and Planning at the University
of Jos, he stood at the intersection of research and national service,
translating years of study and field engagement among the Fulani
communities into a practical, nationwide educational movement. Amongst
his groundbreaking works – The Education of the Nomads: The Fulani of
Northern Nigeria (1983), and Strategies for Training Nomadic Teachers in
Nigeria (1985) – remain foundational references for policymakers and
educators in mobile and marginalized populations. His UNESCO/UNDP Paul
G. Hoffman International Award in 1982 was a global recognition of a
Nigerian scholar whose ideas were ahead of their time.</p>
<p>My personal connection with Prof. Ezeomah began in the 1990s when we
were colleagues and neighbours at the University of Jos Staff Quarters.
I remember his calm intellect and his deep concern for fairness and
national unity. To many of us, he was not only a mentor, but also a
neighbour who embodied the ideals he taught: integrity, service, and
respect for humanity. Born in Umuahia in Eastern Nigeria, he lived and
worked across the country, finally spending his final days in Akure,
Ondo State – a quiet testament to his pan-Nigerian spirit.</p>
<p>Prof. Ezeomah lived a life devoted to education as a tool for
inclusion and national cohesion. His legacy lives on in the lives of the
nomadic children who gained access to formal learning through his
vision, in the scholars he mentored, and in the hearts of those of us
privileged to call him friend.</p>
<p>Rest well, our teacher, neighbour, and patriot. Nigeria remembers
you.</p>

<strong>TRIBUTE TO A HIGHLY RESPECTED SCHOLAR AND
EDUCATIONIST:</strong><br> THE LATE PROFESSOR CHIMAH EZEOMAH (”ARDO”) OF
UNIJOS.
</p>
</div>
<p>As I put down these few words of tribute to the late senior
colleague. I imagine what might have been his last words with his Maker,
thanking Him for living a fulfilled life? I imagine so. Surely, at the
University of Jos, to which he devoted over 90% of his quality life, the
late professor C. Ezeomah (”Ardo”) made a tremendous impact on that
University both institutionally and individually. Having attained the
rank of Professorship, which made him an automatic member of the
senate—the highest academic body of the University—he, in addition, held
several key positions of responsibility within the University. For
example, at various periods he was Head of Department of Arts and Social
Sciences Education; Dean of Education; Director and Head of Research,
Centre for Nomadic Education (on which I’ll say a little more); and
Senate Representative on the Governing Council of the University – the
highest policy–making body of the university. All these were in addition
to his normal teaching and research responsibilities, including project
supervision of students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels,
not to mention mentoring of younger academics undergoing tutelage. It is
in the process of successfully discharging these critical
responsibilities in the university that Professor Ezeomah, in my view,
must have felt fulfilled before his Creator. Humanly speaking and on
account of what I personally knew of him, along with testimonies from
other colleagues, I believe this to be the case. What more would we want
from him? He came; he saw; and he conquered!!!</p>
<p>Yet, there is still a particularly unique area of intellectual,
academic, and practical area of scholarship, research, and practice
attributable to him which posterity should acknowledge. This is in the
area of NOMADIC EDUCATION, which I mentioned earlier: Only God Almighty,
through Prof. Ezeomah’s intellectual curiosity, would understand why a
typical Igbo Professor from Abia State of Nigeria would devote so much
intellectual energy to try to understand and assist the Nigerian Fulani
way of life. This is why he became known as Ardo – a Fulbe word for
Fulani Clan headman or leader. His doctoral thesis focused on developing
strategies for the education of cattle Fulani communities in Nigeria.
This work became the foundational reference base for developing policy
and programme initiatives pertaining to the education of Fulani nomads
and other mobile pastoralist groups in Nigeria in the 1970s and 1980s.
He personally led significant and landmark studies on Fulani access to
schooling and curriculum design. In recognition of his pioneering work
on Fulani nomadic education, he was invited to serve on several
international bodies dealing with pastoralist and nomadic education, and
he was appointed the pioneer Executive Secretary, National Commission
for Nomadic Education. This Commission itself came into being as part of
his recommendation to the Federal Government, keenly supported by
Professor Jibril Aminu and Professor Babs Fafunwa, who were successive
Federal Ministers of Education under whom he served.</p>
<p>Amidst other intellectual and academic exploits of Professor Chimah
Ezeomah, which, I believe, are documented in his curriculum vitae, the
one thing for which he earned both national and global recognition is
NOMADIC EDUCATION symbolized by his popular title of ARDO, explained
earlier. Nomadic education, which, without doubt, was an intellectual
feat, brought Professor Ezeomah into the limelight, much as it promoted
the intellectual and academic profile and image of the University of
Jos. It is on account of this, in particular, that I feel compelled to
put down these few lines of tribute to him as a former Vice Chancellor
of the University.</p>
<p>Well done ARDO!!! REST IN PERFECT PEACE.</p>

<strong>TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR ARDO CHIMAH EZEOMAH</strong>
</div>
<p>It is an honor to write this tribute to Ardo Chimah Ezeomah, a former
senior colleague, husband, father, and grandfather. I first met
Professor Ezeomah when I was the Deputy Vice Chancellor of the
University of Jos in the mid 90s when he was leading the national
eductianal programme for nomadic fulanis. He was a wam gentleman, very
amiable and full of humour. With time, we discovered that we were
neighbours at the Senior Staff Quarters and our children became friends
and playmates.</p>
<p>Professor Ezeomah was very committed to improving the educational
fortunes of the nomadic fulani across the country and the program led to
the graduation of nomadic fulanis at secondary and tertiary levels
across the nation particularly in Northern Nigeria where they were most
concentrated. No wonder he was crowned “Ardo” by the fulani communities
across the nation.</p>
<p>Professor Ezeomah was a good man, full of humour, kind hearted,
generous and real. He was a loving and caring husband and a wonderful
father to his children. I am glad that he laid a strong and solid
foundation for them and I am sure that all his children will live great
lives full of his values and wishes. His beautiful spirit will live on
through his children and they will always remember how much he loved
them.</p>
<p>Professor Ezeomah has lived a good life and left behind many legacies
for his family, his mentees, the academic community he served, the
fulani communities across the country and all those whose lives he
touched.</p>
<p>The loss is there–tangible and real within everyone–but Professor
Ezeomah exemplified life, love, laughter, and an irrepressible belief
and faith in seeing the best in everything.</p>
<p>And so, today we honor him by profoundly feeling and expressing our
loss, but also by remembering Professor Ezeomah as an amazing person who
has played a unique and special role in all of our lives.</p>
<p>“We wish you farewell in your journey to eternity”. “Ardo, you will
be in our hearts and memories”. “It was a privilege for us to have been
a part of your life”.</p>

<strong>TRIBUTE</strong>

<p>As the immediate passed Dean of the Faculty of Education, I deem it
fit to drop some few lines as tribute to late Prof. Ezeomah who was in
the Educational Management Unit , Department of Educational Foundations
, Faculty of Education , University of Jos.</p>
<p>As a one time Director of Nomadic Education , he was honored with the
Fulani title of “Ardo”. As the Director and Ardo , Prof Ezeomah left no
stone unturned in ensuring that Fulanis gained access to quality Western
education. His efforts yielded much harvest as he presented Fulani
university graduates to the University of Jos community.</p>
<p>As a former dedicated lecturer, Dean of Faculty and Director among
other sensitive responsibilities that he held, it becomes crystal clear
that late Prof. Ezeomah has contributed immensely to the progress of his
unit, department, faculty and the University.</p>
<p>As he has departed this world to the great beyond, we fervently pray
that may God Almighty in His infinite mercy grant him merciful judgement
and rest his gentle soul in peace. Amen.</p>

</div>
<p>I was saddened to hear of the recent death of my friend and former
colleague, Prof Ardo Chimah Ezeomah. However, I feel this is a time
predominantly for celebration of his long life well lived: Chimah was
already a senior statesman in the field of nomadic education in Nigeria
by the time he and I first met and started working together nearly three
decades ago, in 1997. He had by then made his mark professionally, as
well as in his personal family life.</p>
<p>Our working and personal relationship grew and evolved from an
initial, potentially single, meeting, when I was asked to come to
Nigeria for a one-week familiarisation and planning visit in order to
design a month’s study tour and course in the UK for a small group of
Nigerian educators who were to be involved in developing a programme to
train basic teachers for nomadic youth. This was part of a community
education project of the British Council with UK (Overseas Development
Administration, ODA) funding support.</p>
<p>I met Chimah at the British Council office in Kano, and we spent a
week going first to Maiduguri, where the teacher education centre of the
National Commission for Nomadic Education (NCNE) was based at the
University, and then, from word-of-mouth recommendation, down to Yola,
to visit the Federal College of Education (FCE). That week led initially
to our planning and designing the one-month programme in UK, which I
coordinated. It also laid the foundations for our subsequent
relationship and work on that project and for our other collaborations
that followed. The participants of that short course in UK, drawn from
faculty members of Unimaid and FCE Yola, formed the core of our working
team, along with the British Council’s project manager, head of the
district education office in Numan.</p>
<p>So, from my introduction to Chimah, I received my orientation to the
world of nomadic education and specifically its history, context, aims
and challenges in Nigeria. Chimah was the ideal mentor, being in many
senses the ‘father of nomadic education’ in the country, as the first
Executive Secretary of the NCNE and as author of papers and books on the
subject, documenting migration patterns, experiments with mobile schools
and much else. His status among the nomadic Fulbe (Fulani) reflected in
his honorary title Ardo (leader) was his proudest professional
honour.</p>
<p>At that time, UK government was not working directly with the Federal
Government of Nigeria, for political reasons (it was the time of the
Abacha government), but we were free to work with the Federal Colleges
of Education and with the State Primary Education Boards, which we
proceeded to do. Most importantly, we worked with the nomadic
communities. The project was a ‘community education project’ not in the
sense of a top-down delivery of education services to communities, but
in being structured around a base of community education committees,
where the nomadic leaders discussed, made decisions and approved the way
forward for project interventions.</p>
<p>Chimah was a proud Igbo, and was fierce and determined in that
identity: he retold the story of one bureaucratic tussle where, facing
what he perceived as an unjustified blockage or misdirection of
resources, he had told his opponent that as he, Chimah, had fought as a
Captain in the bush during the Biafran war, he would not be intimidated
by opposition in a meeting.</p>
<p>It was notable, therefore, that Chimah devoted his professional and
academic life very largely to the cause of the welfare and education of
the nomadic Fulbe (as well as migrant fisherfolk). He only left his base
at University of Jos and moved back southwards, taking his young
children out of school to go with him, following an inter-communal
conflagration in the city and reaching into the campus, which, amid
rising tensions, made him feel it was too perilous to stay.</p>
<p>Chimah felt strongly and advocated for the need for nomadic
cattle-herding pastoralists to have gazetted grazing reserves. This was
to secure the livelihoods of the pastoralists, to facilitate the
development of infrastructure and services for them, and to avoid the
frequent conflicts between pastoralists and sedentary farmers arising
from cattle herds trampling and eating crops and competing for water.
Chimah noted the efforts at negotiated symbiosis of the Savannah Sugar
Company in Adamawa, where the cattle arrived and grazed the stubble
after the sugar crop had been harvested, thus fertilising the land with
cattle dung, to the benefit of the growers. However, more commonly
across the rangelands where pastoralists and their livestock lived and
migrated, there were tensions and sometimes violent conflicts arising
from competition for land and water resources. Chimah was acutely aware
of the social prejudices and injustices often suffered by Fulbe, such as
being the only ones among the passengers on a public minibus to be
searched and questioned at a police roadblock.</p>
<p>Chimah was always generous to me, as to others, with his anecdotes,
ideas, knowledge and questions. We spent many hours on long road
journeys between Abuja, Kano or Jos and Yola, and more locally from Yola
down to Jalingo, or to the local education office in Numan. During these
journeys, we would discuss nomadic education, project issues and ideas,
and much else. Our discussions and sometimes laughter would continue in
the evenings, over dinner, which for Chimah was invariably his favourite
cow-tail soup with pounded yam.</p>
<p>For the first community education project, the nomadic communities
selected the young people who would participate in the course, which was
designed to prepare them to teach their peers. The idea was that these
young teachers would be more effective than teachers drafted into
nomadic schools from outside, since they were themselves based within
the nomadic community, culture, and lifestyle, and supported by their
communities. The course materials were developed by our team of
Maiduguri and Yola faculty, through a series of workshops held at the
FCE and visits for discussions with the nomadic elders and communities
whose members would be the students, and the teaching was delivered on a
residential basis at FCE Yola to a cohort of young Fulbe.</p>
<p>That ODA-funded project was short-term, for a proof of concept,
supporting the conception, development, and a single cycle of
implementation of the teacher preparation course. This experience was
documented in a chapter Chimah and I co-wrote, with two other colleagues
who were involved in a different aspect of the community education
project, and in due course was published internationally.</p>
<p>Chimah and I also worked together on a UK Department for
International Development (DFID)-funded study on nomadic education
issues and policy implications, in a team with members of the
Maiduguri/Yola group, NCNE, and a colleague from NCNE’s migrant
fisherfolk centre in Port Harcourt. This study included two conferences
held in Abuja with wider participation, including education
organisations in Nigeria, pastoralist NGOs, and guests with engagement
in nomadic education from Sudan and Kenya.</p>
<p>The last time I passed through Jos with Chimah, he took me to a
tailor and had an Igbo suit made for me. I was delighted later to have
the opportunity to wear this for the evening of a British Igbo wedding.
Sadly, Chimah and I never undertook our planned trip over the Mambilla
Plateau after a work visit to Adamawa and Taraba, to visit his home in
Abia State. Nevertheless, I hold in my mind his voice, his laughter, his
piercing look, the warmth of his greeting each time we met, and his
generosity of spirit. I cheer his commitment to the cause of the
education and welfare of nomadic people. I feel privileged to have known
and worked with Professor Ardo Chimah Ezeomah, and to have counted him
as a friend.</p>

<strong>Prof. Chimah Ezeomah - A Tribute</strong>
</div>
<p>I write to express my sorrow at the passing and loss of my friend and
colleague – Prof. Chimah Ezeomah (B. Ed., M.Ed., Ph. D.), Prof. of
Education at the University of Jos, Plateau State.</p>
<p>I met Prof. Chimah Ezeomah some 40 years ago at Jos when we became
lecturers and later, Professors – Prof. Ezeomah in the Faculty of
Education, and I, in the Faculty of Environmental Sciences.</p>
<p>Prof. Ezeomah is to be remembered for being someone to depend on;
someone who made every day much better. But above all, Prof. Ezeomah is
to be remembered for his research and scholarship. He created a paradigm
for the education of groups with special problems – a paradigm he
introduced into the Nigerian educational system that attracted many
scholars at Jos, and the Federal Ministry of Education. The paradigm
demonstrated for the education of Fulbe, Fulani, coupled with the
Professor’s hard work, dedication, and passion germinated into practical
education of the nomadic Fulani and the curriculum of Nomadic Education
in Nigerian universities.</p>
<p>Prof. Chimah Ezeomah was my neighbour at the Narraguta Permanent Site
Staff Quarters of the University of Jos, and my family is deeply touched
by his death. I wish the Ezeomah family will take heart, and pray that
God, in His infinite mercy, grant Chimah peace and eternal rest.</p>

<strong>Tribute to a Departed Friend</strong>
</div>
<p>One of South Africa’s finest sons and, indeed, the world’s most
admired leader of the later 20th century captured the inevitability of
death when he said of himself, “Death is something inevitable. When a
man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his
country, he can rest in peace. I believe I have made that effort, and
that is, therefore, why I will sleep for eternity.” (Nelson Madela,
1994).</p>
<p>I can imagine that Prof. Ardo Chimah Ezeomah must have thought like
this in the last few months of his life while battling with age-related
ailments. Prof. Ezeomah, undoubtedly, lived a fulfilled and
well-accomplished life. He served his family, his community, the
University of Jos, and his country, Nigeria, faithfully and
meritoriously. Prof. Ezeomah was very humble and simple, and enjoyed
life with quiet dignity that eschews every form of ostentation. Indeed,
his mien was pervaded with humanity.</p>
<p>Our professor was a dedicated teacher and keen researcher. He has
mentored and supervised scores of students, undergraduate and
postgraduate.</p>
<p>He initiated the curriculum for Nomadic Education at the University
of Jos. He has held many administrative positions at the University of
Jos and beyond including: 1. Dean, Faculty of Education 2. Pioneer
Executive Secretary, National Commission for Nomadic Education.</p>
<p>Those who have encountered Prof. Ardo Chimah Ezeomah will readily
attest that he was very keen and conscientious in every assignment set
before him. He was industrious and trustworthy, and an epitome of
diligence and faithfulness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cold hands of death have snatched this gentleman
from us. Yet, in the words of Quintus Ennius, “Let no one weep for
Prof. Ezeomah or celebrate his funeral with mourning, because this
faithful servant of God still lives on in our daily thoughts.”</p>
<p>Prof. Ezeomah is gone, but his legacies still endure. May God grant
his gentle soul a peaceful repose, and give the Ezeomah family, friends,
in-laws, and well-wishers the fortitude to bear this sad loss.</p>

<strong>FAREWELL TO PROF CHIMAH EZEOMAH (ARDO)</strong>
</div>
<p>Writing about an elderly friend in the past tense is sad but one is
comforted by the fact that he lived a very fulfilled life having
surpassed the proverbial 70 years.</p>
<p>The iroko has fallen indeed. By the time I knew him in1990, he was
already a professor, a reknowned one indeed. A leading expert in nomadic
education. Our friendship was on a social level when I was the chairman
of the University of Jos Staff club where most academics gather to
relax.</p>
<p>He told me a lot about his early childhood, struggles in the teaching
profession and appointment as the first executive secretary of the
National Commission for Nomadic Education in Nigeria. He later became
the leader of the Igbos in the university under the ‘Mahadum’ of which I
was a member.</p>
<p>He was soft spoken, highly articulate, and patient. His diction was
flawless. We grew close and I sometimes dropped him in his house after
meetings. We still kept in touch after his retirement. He visited once
and we kept in touch until the phone calls went silent.</p>
<p>It was with heavy heart that I received the news that he has gone to
be with his maker. He came, he saw and he conquered. His passage should
be a celebration because he gave his all to humanity. He will be missed.
May God welcome him into paradise. Adieu Ardo.</p>

<strong>ODE TO THE GRAND COMMANDER OF INTELLIGENCE, PROFESSOR CHIMAH

PROFESSOR IHENACHO IZUKA JOHN, UNIVERSITY OF JOS

<p>The legend of the legends and the Professor of the Professor of
professors. Professor Chimah Ezeomah is an individual worth millions of
individuals. He exuded strength and poured out energy that surpassed the
ordinary human strength which showed in his lectures. I met him as a
Youth Corper at the University of Jos. He was already an Associate
Professor when the rest of his senior mates were writing strugglers. A
few years later, he ascended the stool of professorship in grand style.
One can hear the mullings of his past and current students calling him
an intellectual workaholic. One can see Professor Ezeomah coming out
from his office and lecture halls with groups of students following him
in batches tapping from his further explanatory notes, the ideas which
quite often few are rarely found in textbooks but are in the textbook of
life experiences acquired over time.</p>
<p>I admired him a lot.</p>
<p>As I went closer and closer to him to study his intellectual ways, he
metamorphosed into an international researcher, winning research grants
not only from the senate of the University of Jos, also from UNESCO/UNDP
to mention but few. One of the uniqueness of Professor Chimah Ezeomah’s
researches is its originality in field context. He spent most of his
time in the actual research field with young growing intelligent fact
finders and harvesters of wisdom. When you see Professor Chimah, you
will notice that he usually has brief discussions to save time for his
research. He did not have time for gossips and petty talks for putting
people down. He was an optimist. He was one of those whose fame brought
University of Jos to national and international fame. He discovered and
collected facts about the lives and times of the Fulani Nomads. His
strategic field works took some of us to the then Gongola state for
months digging up originalities. His research findings gained him world
fame and made the Federal Government of Nigeria create the National
Commission for Nomadic Education. The Government respectfully appointed
him the first Executive Secretary to this National Commission. Senate of
the University of Jos equally approved and created the unit of Nomadic
Education. Federal Government to date created a separate national budget
code for Nomadic Education from then to date. By this singular
achievement, Professor Chimah Ezeomah opened a wide door that has
employed many Nigerians in all the States Ministries of Education.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Professor Chimah Ezeomah was an accomplished
researcher, noble Head of Department, Dean of Education, Permanent
Senate Member of the University of Jos, State Advisor on Nomadic
Education and an intellectual legend whose writings are on the resource
reserved shelves at the National and State libraries both in Nigeria and
abroad. This legend will not be forgotten so soon.</p>

You were very thorough, patient and accommodating but not tolerating

my visits to you both in the office and at your home; and attended to me

<strong>Tribute to Professor (Ardo) Chimah Ezeomah</strong>
</div>
<p>A Life of Commitment – ensuring that generations of children always
on the move are never left behind. I am honoured to honour the cherished
memory of Professor (Ardo) Chimah Ezeomah—renowned scholar,
indefatigable teacher, and relentless pioneer whose life’s work on
education of nomadic peoples changed how Nigeria, and other nations with
pastoralist terrains and populations, think about educating children who
travel with the seasons.</p>
<p>Throughout his journey of service, Prof. Ezeomah carried himself with
distinction, uniquely blending the intellectual rigour of life in
academia with (unusual for academics) deep cultural empathy built from
breathing and living in step with his research participants. He always
listened first—to pastoralist families, to teachers on dusty roads with
no resources, to officials wrestling with policy—and helped build
bridges between them. His scholarship on nomadic education gave
language, data, and dignity to communities too often left out of the
school map. From his years at the University of Jos to his influential
work with UNESCO and Nigerian education authorities, he insisted that
learning must go to the child wherever she may be, not the other way
round.</p>
<p>His books and papers were essential reading in the discourse. He
documented the issues, but also offered practical solutions: mobile
schools, context-relevant curricula, teacher preparation for life on the
move, and policies that respect culture while expanding opportunity.
Generations of researchers and programme designers cite his work for the
clarity, courage, and compassion it brings to a complex challenge of our
modern times.</p>
<p>To his students and colleagues, he was a mentor; to the families he
served, an advocate; to many of us, a moral compass reminding us that
education is a right wherever a child lays their head at night. His
legacy endures in every classroom tent that rises with the herd, in
every teacher trained to teach under open skies, and in every child from
a nomadic family who learns to read, count and dream because the system
finally reached them.</p>
<p>We commend his gentle spirit and towering intellect to God, and we
aspire to carry forward the work he began. Farewell, Prof. Ezeomah. May
the roads you championed for learners now lead you to perfect rest and
peace. Amen.</p>

<strong>Tribute to Late Prof. Ardo Chimah Ezeomah: The Father of Nomadic
Education in Nigeria.</strong>
</div>
<p>Prof. Ardo Chimah Ezeomah was a household name among nomadic Fulani
communities in Nigeria as he was the master key that granted them access
to formal education through the establishment of nomadic education in
Nigeria. He was a father and pillar to every nomadic child in the
country and today we are sadly mourning the passing of a loving and
caring father. He committed his entire life to ensuring people were
treated equally without regard to their tribe, religion or family
background and this was the reason that led him to the idea of a special
education programme for the nomads due to their transhumance nature and
inability to access the conventional system of education.</p>
<p>Dear Prof., I remember very well how you personally drove me in your
car from Jos to Maiduguri just to secure admission for me to study
veterinary Medicine at the University of Maiduguri. Today, I proudly say
that I am a trained veterinarian working at the famous National
Veterinary Institute, Vom, Plateau State, as you ensured I never lacked
anything throughout my study period. e are all witnesses that you lived
your entire life loving and supporting others, and you lived to shine
the light on the nomadic children in Nigeria who have been left in the
dark for decades. Even though you have gone to be with your creator, I
know you can hear my cry, I know you can hear my prayers for you and we
assure you that your love and kindness will live with us and you will
never be forgotten. I pray that God almighty comfort and take care of
your immediate family you left behind, the academia and the nomadic
families across Nigeria. Sleep well my dear Ardo.</p>
<p>Prof. was a caring dad to all of us. I pray and hope that we all will
be able to emulate him even if not all, but some of his attributes.</p>
